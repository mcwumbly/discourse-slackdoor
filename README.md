# Discourse Slackdoor

The `discourse-slackdoor` plugin allows Slack to unfurl links to your private Discourse instance.

Usage:

When you post a message that **starts with** a link to a post or a topic in your private Discourse instance, a bot will post a message that contains the unfurled content as a reply.

Setup:

1. Configure an [outgoing webhook](https://api.slack.com/outgoing-webhooks) on your Slack instance.
2. Install and configure the `discourse-slackdoor` plugin.

## Configure an Outgoing Webhook in Slack

Set the following values for your outgoing webhook:

- Channels: All
- Trigger Word(s): `<https://forum.example.com/t/`
- URL: `https://forum.example.com/slackdoor/knock`
- Token: (autogenerated, but copy value to add to your plugin settings)

You can also choose a name and icon for the bot's posts.

## Install and Configure Discourse-Slackdoor Plugin

1. Install the plugin using this [how to](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157) guide.
2. Go to the Site Settings for your Discourse instance and type `slackdoor` into the filter to show the settings for the plugin.
     - enabled
     - token
     - username

The Token should be set to the value that is generated by Slack when you create the webhook.

The Username should be a user that can see topics you want to be able to share to Slack (but not topics that you *don't* want to share).
